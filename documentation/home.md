### Walk

If he pushes it usually means that he wants to poo. Try to find green areas for him to poo. It may take him some time.

There are red bags for the poo, at almost every bin in the street.

If you bring echo to any excursion, take some water for him in the water dispenser that you can find in Echo's closet.

### Character

He is quite independent and sometimes go at its own at home. Let it do.

## Smart Lights

Some of the lights can only be controlled from the tablet.

If the bathroom light switch does not work, use the tablet to open the light. This should happen very sparsely.

## Waste and Recycling

Normal waste goes to the bag under the sink. When full, bring it to the container machine located at the right when exiting the building. You need a credit card to scan, weight and pay for the amount of waste you have in the bag. This is how we pay the waste tax.

**Cartoon**, **paper**, **aluminum**, **PET** and **glass** is recycled and each one has a container in the Kitchen terrace. **Aluminum** and **glass** can be deposited in the station in front of the building.

## Laundry

Dryer click the button on the left to select a fixed duration (usually 2:30h) to make sure it runs for that specific time.

## Parking

We have a double parking slot, where our car will be parked behind. Feel free to park the car in front. The space is the O1. When entring the [parking](https://goo.gl/maps/C9ezhgMku9KVoLg37), at the end of the ramp, take the first corridor to the right, and then keep straight until you pass some wall that separate the parking into 2 sections. After passing the _door_, our parking space is the one in the right.

If you park the car outside in front, don't forget to register it at the guest tab of the table by putting the license plate of the car.

## Kitchen

Dishwasher tabs can be found next to the trash under the sink.

## Others

You can find towels on the drawer from the main bedroom (where the TV stands) and check the second row of drawers.
