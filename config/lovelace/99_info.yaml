          Schedule:

          * One dose at breakfast ~7h (can be later if you are still sleeping)

          * The second one around 19h


          One dose is filling the plastic cup until the green line.

          ### Walk

          If he pushes it usually means that he wants to poo. Try to find green areas for him to poo. It may take him some time.

          There are red bags for the poo, at almost every bin in the street.

          If you bring echo to any excursion, take some water for him in the water dispenser that you can find in Echo's closet.

          ### Character

          He is quite independent and sometimes go at its own at home. Let it do.

          Some of the lights can only be controlled from the tablet.

          If the bathroom light switch does not work, use the tablet to open the light. This should happen very sparsely.

          Normal waste goes to the bag under the sink. When full, bring it to the container machine located at the right when exiting the building. You need a credit card to scan, weight and pay for the amount of waste you have in the bag. This is how we pay the waste tax.

          **Cartoon**, **paper**, **aluminum**, **PET** and **glass** is recycled and each one has a container in the Kitchen terrace. **Aluminum** and **glass** can be deposited in the station in front of the building.

          We have a double parking slot, where our car will be parked behind. Feel free to park the car in front. The space is the O1. When entring the [parking](https://goo.gl/maps/C9ezhgMku9KVoLg37), at the end of the ramp, take the first corridor to the right, and then keep straight until you pass some wall that separate the parking into 2 sections. After passing the _door_, our parking space is the one in the right.

          If you park the car outside in front, don't forget to register it at the [guest tab](/lovelace/guests) of the table by putting the license plate of the car.

          You can go to the [cleaning tab](/lovelace/cleaning) and ask the vacuum robot to clean some specific rooms, or make a generic clean. When finished, for convenience, it will place itself next the bin to empty the deposit. If the robot doesn't do it itself, you can always push the button "To Empty Bin" to make it go there.
